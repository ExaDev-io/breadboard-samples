# Welcome to The Critic

The Critic is a sample application that demonstrates how to build a complex LLM application using Breadboard.

The Critic analyzes a specification, an article or a blog post and then provides a critique of the content from the perspective of a number of different personalities and roles.

The idea is that this helps you consider other perspectives and improve your writing and answer questions that would be asked by different people.

It generates a report based on the input of the article, and the responses from the panel of fictional critics that are playing a role, and the responses are generated by a machine learning model.

The data generated is fictitious, may be offensive and wildly inaccurate. It is not intended to be taken seriously.
