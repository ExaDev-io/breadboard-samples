# Breadboard Samples

[![Run all demos](https://github.com/ExaDev-io/breadboard-samples/actions/workflows/validate.yml/badge.svg)](https://github.com/ExaDev-io/breadboard-samples/actions/workflows/validate.yml)

This repository contains sample code for the [Breadboard](https://github.com/breadboard-ai/breadboard/) project.

They will demonstrate how to build complex LLM applications that can be run in the browser and be used for a number of use cases such as:

- Summarizing Developer Sentiment
  - [DevPulse](samples/DevPulse)
- Creating Bootstrapped projects (docs, code, etc)
  - [AutoBake](samples/AutoBake)
- Merging multiple docs into a learning path
  - [CourseCrafter](samples/CourseCrafter)
- [TheCritic](samples/TheCritic)

All of this code will be prototype code. It will not be production-ready. It will be used to demonstrate the capabilities of the Breadboard project.

- [Breadboard Walkthrough](samples/Breadboard%20Walkthrough)
